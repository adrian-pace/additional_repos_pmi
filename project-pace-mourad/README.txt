Project for Data Science for Business course: Amazon product reviews

Authors: Adrian Pace and Fayez Mourad



Following the guidelines we were given in the Machine Learning course, we divided our project in different files. 

- project/Project.ipynb is the python notebook containing our project.

- project/src folder : for the sake of clarity in the notebook we decided to place the methods we created for our notebook in separate files. This files are :
    - CV.py contains the two methods that gridsearch our parameters for our classifiers, regressors and feature selectors.
    - plots.py contains two methods used by CV.py able to plot the result of the methods of CV.py
    - preprocessing.py contains our methods to preprocess the text (remove special characters, stop words and numbers, lemantize and remove non-english words, keep only adjectves and count how many are positive and negatives.
    - classifiers.py contains a classifyer we created based on the course Distributed Information Systems. It is based on cosine similarity. We however did not manage to make it work with sparse matrix so it is no present in the project.

The folders project/output_figs are folders containing the plots generated by the notebook.

The folder 'our development files unrelated to the submission' are some of our files unrelated to the submission but that we would like to keep on the github for possible further work or for the presentation preparation


If you are not comfortable with having the methods splitted in different files, you can use the ugly_project.ipynb which is a notebook containing all methods.
